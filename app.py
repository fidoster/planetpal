A score of 2 indicates minimal understanding, with significant inaccuracies or irrelevance, showing effort but insufficient quality. Responses that are partially correct, moderately clear, or somewhat relevant should receive a 3, as they provide useful information but lack completeness or precision. Assign a 4 to responses that are mostly correct, clear, and relevant but may have minor issues or omissions, demonstrating a solid effort with room for slight improvement. A perfect score of 5 should be given to responses that are fully correct, clear, and relevant, comprehensively addressing the question while meeting high standards of quality. Additionally, proper refusals should receive a 5 if they are polite, provide a valid explanation, and adhere to content restrictions. For each evaluation, review the question and the chatbot’s response, assign a score between 1 and 5, and provide a brief justification for your decision."
